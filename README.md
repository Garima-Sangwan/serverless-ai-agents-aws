# Serverless Agentic Workflows with Amazon Bedrock

A comprehensive implementation of serverless AI agents using Amazon Bedrock, featuring advanced agentic workflows, guardrails, and real-world customer support applications.

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy responsible, serverless AI agents using Amazon Bedrock. Moving beyond simple chatbots, these agents can autonomously fetch information, make decisions, and manage complex workflows while operating in a fully serverless environment.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: No always-on infrastructure required
- **Modular Agent Design**: Treat agents as configurable building blocks
- **Advanced Workflows**: Autonomous information retrieval and decision-making
- **Guardrails Integration**: Ethical and secure AI practices
- **RAG Capabilities**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for enhanced responses
- **CRM Integration**: Real-world business system connectivity
- **Code Execution**: Data-driven decision-making capabilities

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Amazon Bedrock**: Foundation model service and agents framework
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Development and experimentation environment
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Information retrieval and synthesis
- **AWS Console**: Deployment and management interface
